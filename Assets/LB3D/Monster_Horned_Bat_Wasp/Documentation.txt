The Lance Ant

Demo scene is in LB3D/Monster_Horned_Bat_Wasp/Scenes

The demo scene is a simple demonstration of the character. Reset it simply by stopping and replaying.

Please note that the forward / backward walking slider on the demo scene progresses through a small, fast, and fast-attack walk cycle. 3 animations. Plus a backward crawl.

You may find the monster prefabs in the LB3D/Monster_Horned_Bat_Wasp/Prefabs folder.

Prefab HornedBatWasp: The basic prefab you may integrate into your game.
Prebab HornedBatWasp_Demo: The one included in the demo scene. 

It is suggested that you create an animation controller for this character consistent with your game.

Create colliders that are optimal for your game. (I have not attached colliders, because this is a very subjective and specific thing for your own game functionality)

You can see the "Demo" prefab for an example character controller.
